            <figcaption><h1>Drake Passage</h1><p>The Drake Passage is the shortest
                 distance from the Antarctic Continent to any other landmass. 
                 It was named after Sir Francis Drake, a British captain who was thought 
                 to have sailed through the waterway in the late 1570s, though many contemporary 
                 historians now place him somewhere else. Some Latin American scholars
                  call the Drake Passage Mar de Hoces, after Francisco de Hoces, who they
                   believe reached the waterway some 50 years before Drake was near it.</p>

                <h1>Ross Sea</h1><p>Cruise to the very heart of Antarctica – gateway to the South Pole 
                and guardian of some of the richest Antarctic treasures. These Ross Sea cruises 
                include visits to the four huts of the historic period – those of Borchgrevink, 
                Scott and Shackleton – plus the American, New Zealand and Italian scientific bases.
                 Some great wildlife, including good opportunities for Emperor Penguins.
                 The expedition includes visits to the New Zealand and Australian Subantarctic Islands.</p>

                 although several restrictions have been put in place to protect the birds.
                  A boardwalk was built a few years ago (Jan - March 2008) to make access for 
                  tourists easier and also to protect the fragile vegetation on the island.</p>

                 abundant wildlife and proximity to Tierra del Fuego, 
                 the South Shetlands are one of Antarctica's most visited areas.
                  This major group of islands is just half a day's cruise across
                   the Bransfield Strait from the Antarctic Peninsula, and all 
                   cruises stop here.</p>

                                    <p> Lemaire Channel is one of the most photogenic spots in Antarctica.
                                     Having been nicknamed “Kodak Gap”, you have an idea why.
                                      This steep-sided channel is a strait located between Kiev Peninsula.
                                       It is also one of the top tourist destinations in the Antarctic
                                        continent with thousands of tourists that travel to Lemaire Channel 
                                        all year long.</p>

                                <p> Port Lockroy is one of the most visited tourist sites in Antarctica.
                                 Port Lockroy is currently the most visited site in the Antarctic,
                                  a popular stopping off place for the tourist vessels cruising the Antarctic Peninsula.
                                  UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) run the station themselves.
                                  Port Lockroy offers visitors much to enjoy: a well-preserved site that is home to the planet’s
                                   southernmost operational post office, a small museum, a well-supplied gift shop,
                                    and a number of breeding gentoo penguins who call the area home.The site is also
                                     of varied historical significance. </p>

                                                   <p> The best time to visit Antarctica is from late spring to early fall, which in the southern hemisphere
                                                     is from October to March.  The first voyages of the season reach
                                                      Antarctica in late spring (end of October or early November) 
                                                      when the sea ice opens up just enough to allow ships into the
                                                       pristine glacial landscapes.  Voyages operate continually from late October,
                                                        until the summer comes to an end, and the wonderfully powerful
                                                        Antarctic autumn begins to arrive by the middle of March.</p>
