                   As English is the dominant one of its four official languages, 
                   it is generally easier for tourists to understand when speaking to the 7
                   local population of the country as a lingua franca, for example, when dining and shopping.
                    Transport in Singapore exhaustively covers most, if not all public venues in Singapore, which increases convenience for tourists.</p>

                 It's a sprawling, organic thing, stretching as far as the eye can see. 
                 Always changing, and with a diverse collection of neighborhoods, no two experiences of the city are ever the same.
                  Some neighborhoods feel like a vision from the future, with ever taller, sleeker structures popping up each year;
                   others evoke the past with low-slung wooden buildings and glowing lanterns radiating surprising warmth; elsewhere,
                    drab concrete blocks hide art galleries and cocktail bars and every lane hints at possible discoveries.</p>
