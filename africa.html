                    that can compare with any of the world destinations.

                <h1>Mauritius</h1><p>Sparkling like a gem in the southern Indian Ocean,
                     Mauritius is an island nation, having a land area of 2,040 kilometers
                      and is officially known as the Republic of Mauritius. 
                      Think Mauritius and your mind instantly conjures up images
                       of powder white beaches and tropical palm trees. However, 
                       the country isn't just about beaches. If you can tear yourself
                        away from the exotic sands for just sometime.
                         Mauritius has a ton of activities, historical sights,
                          and lush forests to offer to its visitors.</p>

                To enjoy a bit of natural beauty, you could take a tour through the Nile,
                 or take deep-sea diving lessons. For fans of history, there’s so much on offer.
                  Do remember to include the Pyramids of Giza, and Abu Simbel temples, 
                  which have giant rock carvings of famous pharaohs,
                   in the itinerary of your Egypt tours.

                Another Egypt tourism favourite is the Museum of Ancient Egypt,
                 a building containing the world’s largest collection of pharaonic artefacts.
                  Tourists often flock to the Great Sphinx, a figure popularised
                   by movies and books over the years. No one exactly knows who built 
                   the Sphinx or why. </p>
